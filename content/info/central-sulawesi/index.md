You have been invited to participate in a research project carried out by researchers at University College London, in collaboration with Universitas Tadulako and Universitas Indonesia. Before you decide whether to participate or not, it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what your participation will involve. Please take time to understand the following information and discuss it with others if you wish before deciding to participate or not. This study has been approved by the UCL Research Ethics Committee; Project ID number: [INSERT HERE]. Thank you.


## Project purpose

In disasters, households often leave their habitual residence due to safety concerns or evacuation orders. These households may temporarily seek shelter in a variety of places, such as with family and friends or in emergency camps. However, as time goes on, some households may be unable or unwilling to return to their previous residence. In these situations, they may need to continue to relocate as they search for or await permanent housing. Protracted displacement is associated with significant hardships for households, such as loss of livelihood, the disruption of education, psychosocial issues, and worsened housing conditions. In this study, we seek to understand the factors that drove different relocation outcomes (i.e., distance, duration, number of moves) and the consequences of those relocation outcomes on household recovery and wellbeing.

## Frequently asked questions

<details>
<summary>Why have I been chosen?</summary>
  You have been invited to participate in this survey because you are between 18 and 70 years old and live in a household potentially affected by the September 2018 Central Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami. If you do not meet this criteria, you will not be eligible to participate.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I have to participate?</summary>
  Participation is voluntary -- you decide whether or not to take part. If you decide to participate, you will be asked to consent on this form. Even if you provide consent, you are able to withdraw at any time. If you decide to withdraw, we will ask you what you wish to happen to the data provided thus far.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What will happen if I participate?</summary>
  Participation involves completing a questionnaire that asks you about your housing conditions before the 2018 Central Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami, the disaster impacts on your household, your relocation trajectory and factors that influenced relocation decisions, and your wellbeing during each of those relocations. Additionally, we may ask some "what if?" questions to understand how different factors could have changed your relocation decisionmaking. This survey should take about 20 minutes to complete. By participating, we will be able to better understand household recovery after post-disaster relocation. The findings may help inform future disaster recovery planning.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of participating?</summary>
  We acknowledge the potential risk of trauma-triggering effects, particularly if you have experienced the negative impacts of past disasters. Discussing sensitive topics or recalling distressing memories related to disasters may potentially evoke emotional distress. To manage this risk, we have designed the survey in a sensitive and considerate manner. You can also opt out or skip specific questions that you find distressing. Additioanlly, you can withdraw from participating at any time without giving a reason.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the possible benefits of participating?</summary>
  While there are no immediate benefits, we hope that this research will offer valuable insights to improve recovery planning in future disasters.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What if something goes wrong?</summary>
  If you have a concern or complaint about any aspect of this study, you should email the principal researcher c.galasso@ucl.ac.uk. He will do his best to answer your questions or deal with your query. If you feel your complaint has not been handled satisfactorily or if you prefer to contact someone independent of the research team, you can contact the Chair of the UCL Research Ethics Committee at ethics@ucl.ac.uk
