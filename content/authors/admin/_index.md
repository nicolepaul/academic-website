I'm currently researching household displacement due to disasters at University College London (UCL). My background is in structural engineering and I have over nine years of experience quantifying disaster risks. At the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation, I conducted earthquake risk assessment at the national and regional scales. At Arup, I was focused on the campus and building-specific scales, with an emphasis on modeling recovery after disasters.
